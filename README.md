## ABOUT ME 

My name is Kenan KariÄ‡.  On this site I would like to share my all gained experience from personal studies and researches. In December I finished the course of QA and software tester at ITAcademy in Sarajevo. Regarding my formal education I have finished the BA of Journalism/Communicology at the Faculty of political sciences in Sarajevo. 

Currently I am working as a multimedia journalist at Oslobodjenje media group in Sarajevo. However I want to pursue the career of QA and to develop in that field in the future.
